This filter is based on the sample thesis provided on LMS.

The testbench is modified with a 2.5kHZ sampling frequency. It should be correct.

The input signal is a 5.6kHZ wave from matlab. Put the test_data txt file under the project folder and the work folder under it.

The input can be checked in modelsim but the output is "0", so the filter design may be wrong.
